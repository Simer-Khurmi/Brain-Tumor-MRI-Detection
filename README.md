Background: Brain tumors, which can be benign or malignant, pose significant health risks depending on their type, location, and size. Early detection is crucial for timely medical intervention and improved patient outcomes.
Motivation: The motivation behind automated brain tumor detection using MRI lies in the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods, such as CT scans and biopsies, which are invasive and may not provide sufficient detail for accurate diagnosis. MRI offers high-resolution imaging that aids in precise localization and characterization of tumors, making it a preferred modality in neuroimaging.
Objectives: The primary objective of this research is to develop and evaluate a deep learning-based system for automated brain tumor detection using MRI images. Specific goals include:
Designing a robust deep learning architecture capable of accurately detecting brain tumors from MRI scans.
Evaluating the system's performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to existing methods.
Demonstrating the potential clinical impact of AI-driven diagnostic tools in enhancing healthcare delivery.
Methodology:
Data Collection:
Compile a comprehensive dataset of MRI brain scans, ensuring a variety of tumor types, sizes, and locations.
Data Preprocessing:
Normalize the MRI images to ensure consistency.
Apply data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the training dataset.
Model Design:
Develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture tailored for brain tumor detection.
Include layers for convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers to extract features and classify tumors.
Training and Validation:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the CNN model using the training set, validating its performance on the validation set to tune hyperparameters.
Evaluation:
Assess the model's accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using the test set.
Compare the results with traditional diagnostic methods and other AI-based approaches.
Expected Outcomes:
A CNN model capable of detecting brain tumors from MRI images with high accuracy.
Enhanced diagnostic efficiency, reducing the time required for medical professionals to analyze MRI scans.
Improved patient outcomes through timely and accurate diagnosis.
